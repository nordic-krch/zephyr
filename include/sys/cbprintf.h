 *
 * * @p c a character to output.  The output behavior should be as if
 *   this was cast to an unsigned char.
 * * @p ctx a pointer to an object that provides context for the
 *   output operation.
 *
 * The declaration does not specify the parameter types.  This allows a
 * function like @c fputc to be used without requiring all context pointers to
 * be to a @c FILE object.

 * @return the value of @p c cast to an unsigned char then back to
 * int, or a negative error code that will be returned from
 * cbprintf().
